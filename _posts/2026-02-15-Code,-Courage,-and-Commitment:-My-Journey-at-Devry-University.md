Going back to school as a transgender student wasn't just about earning a degree. It was about proving to myself that I belong in every room I step into — including the tech world.

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Software Development at DeVry University, and this journey has been about more than code, assignments, and deadlines. It has been about growth, rethinking who I am, and discovering my strength.

Starting Over — But Stronger

Making the decision to pursue my degree wasn't easy. Life doesn't pause just because you enroll in classes. I balance responsibilities, personal challenges, and the everyday realities of being a transgender woman navigating an education system built before I fully understood myself.

But here's what I've learned: growth rarely happens inside your comfort zone.

In software development, you're constantly problem-solving. Debugging. Testing. Rewriting. That process mirrors my life in many ways. Transitioning has meant learning who I am at a deeper level, accepting my authentic self, and building confidence in spaces that weren't always designed for people like me.

Just like refactoring code, personal growth takes patience.

Representation in Tech Matters

The tech industry is growing fast, but representation still matters. Being a transgender student in software development sometimes feels isolating. There aren't always visible role models who look like me or share my story. The statistics are sobering: women make up only about 25% of computing roles, and transgender people in tech are even more underrepresented.

But instead of letting that discourage me, I let it motivate me.

Every assignment I complete, every project I submit, and every programming language I learn is a reminder that I deserve to be here. Diversity in tech isn't just about statistics — it's about building solutions that serve everyone, not just a select few.

Innovation thrives on different viewpoints.

The Challenge of Balancing Identity and Education

There are moments when school stress mixes with personal stress. Deadlines don't care if you're dealing with emotional challenges. Code won't compile just because you've had a tough day.

But resilience is a skill — just like programming.

At DeVry University, I've developed discipline, time management, and persistence. Late nights debugging have taught me patience. Group discussions have strengthened my communication skills. And every exam passed has reinforced my belief that I can do hard things.

Each semester completed feels like both an academic and personal milestone.

Why Software Development?

Software development appealed to me because it's creative and logical at the same time. It's building something from nothing. It's solving real-world problems with structured thinking.

There's something empowering about writing code that works. About seeing your application run successfully. It reminds me that I can build the life I want — one line at a time.

Technology doesn't judge. It responds to logic, structure, and effort. In many ways, coding has been a safe space for me — a place where my identity doesn't limit my potential.

Looking Ahead

Earning my BS in Software Development isn't just about career advancement. It's about stability. It's about creating opportunities. It's about showing others — especially other transgender people considering STEM fields — that we belong here.

I want to be visible. I want to be skilled. I want to contribute.

My journey at DeVry University is shaping not only my future career but also my confidence as a person. Every course brings me closer to graduation, but also closer to the life I've worked hard to build.

Final Thoughts

Being a transgender student in software development means navigating challenges that aren't always in the syllabus. But it also means bringing strength, adaptability, and authenticity into everything I do.

I am not just learning to write code.

I am building a future.

And I'm doing it unapologetically.
